Our goal is to train a model that is able to accurately predict the presence of endometriosis, a chronic disease which affects ~10% of women worldwide and has no cure. Endometriosis is a poorly understood disease that is characterized by uterine tissue cells growing outside of the uterus, which can be debilitating and fertility-impacting. In many cases, multiple surgeries (sometimes the complete removal of a uterus) are required for managing this condition. Furthermore, early detection procedures for endometriosis such as pelvic exams, abdominal ultrasounds, MRIs, and laparoscopy are either expensive, inaccurate, or invasive – sometimes all three. This leads to many late diagnoses of endometriosis, due to extraneous factors affecting the clinician's willingness to test early. For this reason, the average time until diagnosis is 7 years.\n","\n","In hopes to facilitate more research on endometriosis, researchers at the University of Turku in Finland created a dataset with more than 392 unique samples, documenting the expression of thousands of genes in each sample, as outlined above. Note, because endometriosis is the growth of uterine tissue outside of the uterus, some patients contributed multiple unique samples from different places on their body. The final output of the Turku-led project was a user interface for assisting researchers. However, we were able to collect their raw data, which they claim was normalized, but the scale makes us believe it was likely standardized. The data was also batch-controlled, meaning that the research team accounted for technical differences arising from the use of different machines for analyzing samples — this way, we are capturing biological differences, as opposed to technical measurement differences."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZFPetrCclS_A"},"source":["# Loading the data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":98,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ErwJ0f1MrVBl","outputId":"7e1aef79-4ceb-44c3-9e89-620702a44625","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746506353071,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":128695,"user":{"displayName":"Eyob Davidoff","userId":"14427914670191991033"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["File already exists.\n","Data loaded successfully.\n"]}],"source":["filePath = \"content/GSE141549_batchCorrectednormalizedArrayscombined.xlsx\"\n","\n","# URL for downloading the file\n","url = \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE141549&format=file&file=GSE141549%5FbatchCorrectednormalizedArrayscombined%2Exlsx\"\n","\n","# checking if the file already exists\n","if not os.path.exists(filePath):\n","    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(filePath), exist_ok=True)\n","    # Download the file if it doesn't exist\n","    response = requests.get(url)\n","    with open(filePath, \"wb\") as file:\n","        file.write(response.content)\n","    print(\"File downloaded.\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"File already exists.\")\n","\n","# loading the Excel file into a pandas DataFrame\n","df = pd.read_excel(filePath)\n","print(\"Data loaded successfully.\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cIj5cVzxlNji"},"source":["# Simple exploration of raw dataset and processing steps"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rgQs_uSgyiRm"},"source":["### First few rows"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":99,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":259},"id":"acDku18FR3wE","outputId":"9aa58685-73fb-444e-f3ef-7d6119a529f0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746506353075,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":26,"user":{"displayName":"Eyob Davidoff","userId":"14427914670191991033"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["    Gene_symbol      Probe_Id  SAMPLE 332 PE  SAMPLE 333 DiEIn  SAMPLE 334 PE  \\\n","0          RERE  ILMN_1802380      11.488459         11.605685      12.006795   \n","1  LOC105374121  ILMN_1736104       6.673564          6.520175       6.619677   \n","2         CIDEA  ILMN_1788184       6.680433          6.588961       6.593340   \n","3       SLC17A3  ILMN_1690979       6.772489          6.482288       6.579807   \n","\n","   SAMPLE 335 PeLB  SAMPLE 336 PE  SAMPLE 337 PE  SAMPLE 338 PP  \\\n","0        12.132273      11.416302      12.186470      11.340178   \n","1         6.514652       6.602206       6.596461       6.805189   \n","2         7.795417       6.598428       6.666354       8.203924   \n","3         6.409611       6.361172       6.496526       6.489509   \n","\n","   SAMPLE 339 SuL  ...

However, oversampling with SMOTE can compromise the privacy guarantees of a differentially private model, as the model might overfit specific population subsets. Currently, there are no readily available \"plug-and-play\" DP resampling libraries; most implementations are tailored to specific use cases. Nevertheless, substantial performance improvements achieved using SMOTE indicate that class imbalance in the original dataset significantly affects model performance. This insight motivates us to explore alternative approaches to SMOTE that preserve differential privacy, such as class weighting and undersampling."],"metadata":{"id":"xfdSWxFhnYVY"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Define a function to process and train on a dataset\n","def process_and_train_cnn(X, y, label):\n","    # Split dataset\n","    X_train_full, X_test, y_train_full, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y, test_size=0.2, random_state=random_state)\n","    X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train_full, y_train_full, stratify=y_train_full, test_size=0.2, random_state=random_state)\n","\n","    # Standardize\n","    scaler = StandardScaler()\n","    X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\n","    X_val_scaled = scaler.transform(X_val)\n","    X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)\n","\n","    # Reshape for CNN input\n","    n_features = X_train_scaled.shape[1]\n","    X_train_scaled = X_train_scaled.reshape(-1, n_features, 1)\n","    X_val_scaled   = X_val_scaled.reshape(-1, n_features, 1)\n","    X_test_scaled  = X_test_scaled.reshape(-1, n_features, 1)\n","\n","    # CNN model\n","    def build_cnn_model(input_shape):\n","        model = Sequential([\n","            Input(shape=input_shape),\n","            Conv1D(32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),\n","            MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),\n","            Flatten(),\n","            Dense(64, activation='relu'),\n","            Dropout(0.5),\n","            Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')\n","        ])\n","        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n","        return model\n","\n","    model = build_cnn_model(input_shape=(n_features, 1))\n","\n","    # Train\n","    history = model.fit(\n","        X_train_scaled, y_train,\n","        validation_data=(X_val_scaled, y_val),\n","        epochs=20,\n","        batch_size=32,\n","        verbose=0\n","    )\n","\n","    # Evaluate\n","    train_acc = history.history['accuracy'][-1]\n","    val_acc   = history.history['val_accuracy'][-1]\n","    test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test_scaled, y_test, verbose=0)\n","\n","    print(f\"{label} - Train Accuracy: {train_acc:.4f}, Val Accuracy: {val_acc:.4f}, Test Accuracy: {test_acc:.4f}\")\n","\n","    return history, test_acc\n","\n","X1, y1 = resampled_df.drop(columns=[\"disease\"]), resampled_df[\"disease\"]\n","X2, y2 = transposedDF.drop(columns=[\"label\",\"disease\"]), transposedDF[\"disease\"]\n","X2.columns = X2.columns.astype(str)\n","\n","# Run experiments\n","history1, test_acc1 = process_and_train_cnn(X1, y1, label=\"SMOTE Dataset\")\n","history2, test_acc2 = process_and_train_cnn(X2, y2, label=\"Original Dataset\")"],"metadata":{"id":"KC5cV3l9hCaZ","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1746506705960,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":481631,"user":{"displayName":"Eyob Davidoff","userId":"14427914670191991033"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Visualization of Model Performance vs Dataset\n","def plot_history(history, label,line_color=\"\"):\n","    plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], line_color, label=f'{label} Train',linestyle='dashed')\n","    plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'],line_color, label=f'{label} Val')\n","\n","plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n","plot_history(history1, \"SMOTE Dataset\", \"orange\")\n","plot_history(history2, \"Original Dataset\", \"navy\")\n","plt.title(\"Training vs Validation Accuracy\")\n","plt.xlabel(\"Epoch\")\n","plt.ylabel(\"Accuracy\")\n","plt.legend()\n","plt.grid(True)\n","plt.show()"],"metadata":{"id":"lLYYkNxnjxKy","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1746506705962,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"Eyob Davidoff","userId":"14427914670191991033"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Model Performance with an Undersampled Dataset\n","\n","Our experiment demonstrates significant improvement in model performance when using the SMOTE oversampled dataset.
